# How do I get started?
First, Python must be installed.
Please install Python [here](https://www.python.org/).
We have tested this assignment on Python versions 3.10+.
Please choose a version accordingly.

Next, please set up your virtual environment and install all dependencies.
On Linux, use the following commands:
```
python3 -m venv venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
The setup can be done as follows on Windows:
```
py -m venv venv
./venv/Scripts/activate.bat
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

In order to launch the Jupyter notebook, use the following command:
```
jupyter lab
```
If run locally, this command should automatically open the Jupyter Lab web app.
Please use the web app to open `assignment1.ipynb`, and read the instructions there.
